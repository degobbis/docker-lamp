This is the base directory for the domains wp.local and wp.test including the subdomain www.

It is configured for the use of **Wordpres**. All other subdomains like *.wp.local or *.wp.test end up in a subdirectory with the name of the subdomain.

Note that for Wordpress only the default mapped PHP version will work (MAP_POT_80, MAP_POT_443).
